# Introduction
We present here aircraft measurements of SOA over Niger, using an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (Allan, 2004).

Joe Bloggs has alrewady made some awesome measurements, but hasn't answered all the science yet.

Jim Haywood (200) made aircraft measurements over the Sahel, focussing on radioactive forcing.
