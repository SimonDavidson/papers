# Introduction
We present here aircraft measurements of SOA over Niger, using an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (Allan, 2004).

Joe Bloggs has alrewady made some awesome measurements, but hasn't answered all the science yet.

Jim Haywood (200) made aircraft measurements over the Sahel, focussing on radioactive forcing.

# Simulations
John ran his atmospheric model to simulate SOA formation.

# Methodology
Measurements were made using an AMS, as described in Allan et al 2003.

# Results
The simulations reproduced the meaaurements nicely, supportimng the formation process proposed in our previous paper.
However, we still haven't answered question X, so we'll not retire yet...

# Conclusions
We did the science. New insights into particle formation were discovered.

# Figures
This is where the figures go.
